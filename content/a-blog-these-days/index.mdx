## Hasn't this gone out of style?

When we consider how content is consumed today, one might think so. The transformation in how we consume information on the Internet has been dramatic: we've transitioned from the golden age of the _blogosphere_, where every enthusiast shared their thoughts from their digital corner, to a world dominated by ultra-brief audiovisual content. It's as if we've moved from a library filled with personal essays to a cinema that only shows trailers.

However, this apparent obsolescence of the blog format conceals a deeper truth. Written content, especially that born from personal passion and experience, maintains a unique quality that brief audiovisual content can rarely match. It's like comparing a deep conversation with a friend over coffee to the quick exchange of messages on social media. Both have their place, but they serve fundamentally different purposes.

The flexibility of the blog format is comparable to a blank canvas for an artist. You're not constrained by algorithms favoring certain durations or specific formats. You can explore a complex technical idea with the detail it deserves, share a personal experience with all its nuances, or present exhaustive research without worrying about artificial restrictions.

The experience of reading blogs also has its own particular magic. Each blog is like a window into a personal universe, an opportunity to learn not only from the explicit knowledge being shared but also from the unique way each author processes and presents that knowledge. It's a more contemplative and profound way of consuming content, something especially valuable in our current digital landscape saturated with ephemeral stimuli.

Discovering valuable blogs resembles a digital treasure hunt. There are primarily two discovery routes: the first is when you're researching something specific (like integrating a Headless CMS with Next.js) and, among the sea of AI-generated and SEO-optimized content, you find someone's blog who not only solved the problem but documented their process with dedication and detail. The second route is through cross-references between blogs, similar to how the Internet worked in its early days, creating an organic network of interconnected knowledge.

The moment of discovering a personal blog about a topic you thought was exclusively niche is comparable to finding an old diary that perfectly resonates with your current interests. That instant when you discover someone has been documenting since 2004 a topic you thought only passionate you, creates a unique intellectual connection, even if it's through bits and bytes.

## Is that what I intend to achieve with this blog?

The answer is more complex than a simple yes or no. While I would like this space to become one of those hidden Internet treasures, a place where people find value, reflection, and authenticity, the reality is that this blog was born first as a personal exercise in expression and improvement.

Writing, especially in a language that isn't my mother tongue, represents a challenge similar to learning a new musical instrument. Each entry is practice, each paragraph an opportunity to improve technique. I'm not aiming to create a masterpiece with every publication, but rather to maintain a space where I can explore ideas, document learnings, and, above all, enjoy the writing process itself.

## And now?

I would like to recommend blogs that I find particularly enriching, beyond the typical blogging platforms like Medium, Dev.to, hashnode, or others. These blogs stand out for their thoughtful content and distinctive voice:

1. [**Coding Horror**](https://blog.codinghorror.com/): A blog by Jeff Atwood about programming and software development with interesting anecdotes and practical advice.
2. [**Overreacted**](https://overreacted.io/): A blog by Dan Abramov, practically the godfather of React, one of the creators of Redux and a developer on the React team, where he shares his thoughts on development and software.
3. [**Flavio Copes**](https://flaviocopes.com/): A blog by Flavio Copes that offers tutorials and resources on web development, including JavaScript, Node.js, and more.
4. [**Kent C. Dodds**](https://kentcdodds.com/blog): A blog by Kent C. Dodds, a well-known developer and educator in the world of JavaScript, React, and testing.
5. [**UI from Mars**](https://www.uifrommars.com/): A blog by Cris Busquets about interface design and user experience, with resources and practical tips for designers and developers.

And one a little offtopic that I love and highly recommend:

1. [**The Marginalian**](https://www.themarginalian.org/): Created by Maria Popova, this blog is a mix of literature, history, science and art, offering deep and beautifully written reflections.

Each of these blogs represents a unique voice in their respective fields, offering not just information, but perspective and insight that can transform how we think about their subjects. I hope you find them as enlightening as I do. Happy reading!
